### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Cecilija and I am a Game Programming student at Forsbergs since September 2021.

## I have studied:

C# with Unity

C++ with UnrealEngine 

I have completed courses (10 weeks, 2021) in GameArt. 

## Education / Work experience:

I have a Master's Degree in Fine Arts and I have also studied Political Science. For many years I have worked with Intellectual Property at several Patent Offices here in Stockholm and have my own two patents also. I have had business experience where I owned a company that designed Mother & Child Clothing for several years. Check it out here www.cecilijas.com

## About me:

In my free time I am with my children and play games. Game development is a fun industry, and the Covid-19 pandemic made me decide to change the path of my career to it.
